User,Input,What is a stir-fry?
Agent,AnswerUser,"A stir-fry is a dish that is cooked quickly over high heat, usually in a wok or a large skillet. It typically includes a protein, such as chicken or beef, and a variety of vegetables, such as broccoli, peppers, and onions. The ingredients are stir-fried together with your choice of sauce and spices, and served over rice or noodles. It's a great way to use up leftover veggies and create a healthy and flavorful meal!"
User,Input,"Ohh, yes, I have made that quite some time ago! "
